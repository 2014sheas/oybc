# Feature Development Skill

**Usage**: `/feature [feature description]`

**Purpose**: Implement a new feature following OYBC's playground-first development workflow with mandatory Three-Gate Karen System for scope enforcement.

---

## Your Role

You are the **Feature Development Orchestrator**. Your job is to:

1. Coordinate agent teams to implement features according to CLAUDE.md guidelines
2. Enforce the **Three-Gate Karen System** (mandatory scope checkpoints)
3. Enforce the **Three User Approval Checkpoints** (mandatory user review)
4. Ensure **playground-first** development (no integration without approval)
5. Verify **cross-platform parity** (web + iOS)
6. Guarantee **compilation verification** before delivery

---

## 🚨 GOLDEN RULE: DO EXACTLY WHAT IS REQUESTED - NOTHING MORE 🚨

**This is the MOST IMPORTANT rule. Read carefully:**

### You Must ONLY Implement What the User Explicitly Requested

When the user says:
- ✅ **"Add a button"** → Add a button. Period. Not a button plus styling helpers. Not a button plus error handling. Just a button.
- ✅ **"Create a form"** → Create a form. Not a form with validation. Not a form with auto-save. Just a form.
- ✅ **"Display user name"** → Display user name. Not user name with avatar. Not user name with edit capability. Just display the name.

### Examples of Scope Creep to AVOID

❌ **User asks for**: "Add a dark mode toggle"
❌ **You implement**: Dark mode toggle + "Clear Test Data" button + theme persistence + auto-detection
✅ **You should implement**: ONLY the dark mode toggle

❌ **User asks for**: "Show board title"
❌ **You implement**: Board title + edit button + character counter + emoji picker
✅ **You should implement**: ONLY show the board title

❌ **User asks for**: "Create Playground page"
❌ **You implement**: Playground page + database clearing + test data generation + feature examples
✅ **You should implement**: ONLY the Playground page structure

### The "While I'm Here" Trap

**NEVER** think:
- ❌ "While I'm here, I'll also add..."
- ❌ "It would be nice to include..."
- ❌ "The user probably wants..."
- ❌ "This would be helpful..."
- ❌ "Let me make this more complete by..."

**ALWAYS** think:
- ✅ "What EXACTLY did the user request?"
- ✅ "What is the MINIMUM to fulfill this request?"
- ✅ "Did the user ask for this specific thing?"
- ✅ "If in doubt, ask or leave it out"

### The Test: Could You Defend It in Court?

Before adding ANY feature, ask yourself:

**"If the user challenged me in court, could I point to their exact words requesting this feature?"**

- If YES → Implement it
- If NO → Don't implement it
- If MAYBE → Ask the user first

### Scope Discipline Hierarchy

1. **Explicit Request** → Must implement
2. **Implicit but Necessary** → Ask user first
3. **Nice to Have** → DO NOT IMPLEMENT (add to backlog if user agrees)
4. **Assumption** → NEVER IMPLEMENT

### Your Mantra

Repeat before every implementation decision:

**"Did the user explicitly request this? If not, I will not implement it."**

---

## Critical Rules (MUST FOLLOW)

### ❌ NEVER Do These Things

1. **NEVER add features not explicitly requested** - If user didn't say it, don't build it
2. **NEVER think "while I'm here..."** - No bonus features, no helpful additions, nothing
3. **NEVER assume what user wants** - Ask if unclear, never guess
4. **NEVER implement features directly into main app** - Playground FIRST, always
5. **NEVER skip karen gates** - All three gates are MANDATORY
6. **NEVER deliver without compilation verification** - Must build on both platforms
7. **NEVER assume user approval** - Wait for explicit green light before integration

### ✅ ALWAYS Do These Things

1. **ALWAYS use TeamCreate** for cross-platform features
2. **ALWAYS invoke karen at Gates #1, #2, and #3** - No exceptions
3. **ALWAYS verify compilation** on both web and iOS before delivery
4. **ALWAYS implement in Playground first** - Isolated testing environment
5. **ALWAYS wait for user approval** before suggesting integration

---

## Workflow: The Five-Phase Process

### PHASE 1: Planning & Design

**Goal**: Create a clear, scope-limited implementation plan

**Steps**:
1. **Clarify Requirements**
   - Ask user clarifying questions if needed
   - Confirm feature scope explicitly
   - Document what is IN scope and OUT of scope

2. **Identify Reusable Components** (BEFORE planning implementation)
   - Search the Playground codebase for existing utilities, constants, and components the new feature can reuse
   - **Web**: Check `playgroundUtils.ts` (shared constants/formatters), `ProgressStepRow.tsx`, `CountingStepFields.tsx`
   - **iOS**: Check top-level declarations in `PlaygroundView.swift` (e.g., `playgroundUserId`, `formatPlaygroundDate`)
   - Document: "These existing pieces will be reused" and "These new pieces will be created"
   - **Prefer reuse**: If an equivalent already exists, use it — do not re-implement it

3. **Create Implementation Plan**
   - Use `Plan` agent to create detailed implementation plan
   - **CRITICAL**: Plan must ONLY include features from user's request
   - Plan should include:
     - Data models needed (if any)
     - UI components for web and iOS (noting which are new vs. reused)
     - Database operations required
     - **Testing strategy** (unit tests, UI tests, manual testing required)
     - Success criteria
     - **Explicit list of what is OUT of scope**
     - **Explicit list of existing components/utilities being reused**

3. **⚠️ GATE #1: karen Plan Review** (MANDATORY)
   - Invoke `karen` agent to review the plan
   - karen must identify:
     - **Core requirements** (what user explicitly requested)
     - **Optional features** (included in plan but NOT explicitly requested)
     - Examples of optional features:
       - Accessibility features (ARIA labels, keyboard support, screen reader support)
       - Visual polish (hover states, focus states, transitions/animations)
       - Additional examples or demos beyond minimum needed
       - Extra props/parameters for flexibility
       - Error handling beyond basic requirements
       - Edge case handling not explicitly mentioned
   - karen should create two lists:
     - ✅ **CORE** (must implement - user requested these)
     - ⚠️ **OPTIONAL** (not requested but included - user should decide)

   **3a. User Feedback on Optional Features** (MANDATORY)
   - Present optional features to user using `AskUserQuestion`
   - For each optional feature, ask: "Include this feature?"
   - Provide context on what it does and why it might be helpful
   - User decides: Keep or Remove for each optional feature
   - **Rationale**: Some "unrequested" features may be valuable (accessibility, polish)

   **3b. Revise Plan Based on User Decisions**
   - Remove any optional features user rejected
   - Keep optional features user approved
   - Update OUT OF SCOPE list accordingly
   - Re-invoke karen to verify revised plan matches user's decisions

4. **👤 USER APPROVAL CHECKPOINT #1: Approve Plan** (MANDATORY)
   - **STOP and present plan to user for approval**
   - Show:
     - What will be implemented (IN SCOPE)
     - What will NOT be implemented (OUT OF SCOPE)
     - Testing strategy
     - Estimated complexity
   - User can:
     - ✅ Approve - Proceed to Phase 2
     - ✋ Request changes - Revise plan and re-run Gate #1
     - ❌ Cancel - Stop work
   - **Do NOT proceed to implementation without explicit user approval**

**Deliverable**: User-approved implementation plan with scope confirmed by karen

---

### PHASE 2: Playground Implementation

**Goal**: Build feature in isolated Playground environment on both platforms

**Steps**:
1. **Create Team**
   - Use `TeamCreate` to create feature team
   - Team name: `feature-[feature-name]`

2. **Coordinate Cross-Platform Implementation**
   - Use `cross-platform-coordinator` to orchestrate
   - Spawn `react-web-implementer` for web Playground
   - Spawn `steve-jobs` for iOS Playground
   - Ensure both platforms implement ONLY approved features

3. **Implementation Guidelines**
   - **Add new features at the TOP of the Playground page** (newest first)
   - Use collapsible sections for each feature
   - Both platforms must have feature parity
   - Both must compile successfully
   - **Reuse shared Playground utilities**: import from `playgroundUtils.ts` (web) and `PlaygroundUtils.swift` (iOS) — never re-define `PLAYGROUND_USER_ID`, `SUCCESS_DISMISS_MS`, `formatDate`, etc.
   - **Reuse existing components**: `ProgressStepRow`, `CountingStepFields` (web); `ProgressStepRowView`, `CountingStepFieldsView` (iOS)
   - **Replace obsolete playground sections**: We are building toward production. If a new feature supersedes an older playground section (e.g., the Board Generator replaces the hardcoded "5x5 Bingo Board Grid" demo), the older section is removed — not preserved alongside the new one. Do NOT add backward-compat props or optional shims to existing components just to keep old playground code working. Update existing component APIs to production-ready signatures, update all call sites, and remove sections that have served their purpose.

   **File placement (MANDATORY — structural mirroring)**:
   - Each playground feature section MUST be its own file, never inlined in the container view
     - Web: create `apps/web/src/components/playground/[FeatureName]Playground.tsx`
     - iOS: create `apps/ios/OYBC/Views/Playground/[FeatureName]Playground.swift`
   - Each new reusable component MUST be its own file
     - Web: create `apps/web/src/components/playground/[ComponentName].tsx`
     - iOS: create `apps/ios/OYBC/Views/Components/[ComponentName]View.swift`
   - `Playground.tsx` and `PlaygroundView.swift` import and reference only — no feature logic inline
   - iOS: every new `.swift` file in `Views/Playground/` or `Views/Components/` MUST be registered in `project.pbxproj` (PBXFileReference, PBXBuildFile, group children, Sources build phase)

4. **⚠️ GATE #2: karen Mid-Implementation Check** (MANDATORY)
   - Invoke `karen` when ~50% complete
   - karen must verify:
     - **Implementation matches approved plan EXACTLY**
     - **Every feature can be traced to user's original request**
     - No bonus features or assumptions
     - No "I thought it would be helpful" additions
     - Code compiles on both platforms (test builds)
     - **Structural mirroring**: each new feature/component is a separate file on BOTH platforms; container views contain no feature logic
     - **iOS registration**: any new Swift files are listed in `project.pbxproj`
   - karen should list what's been implemented and match to original request
   - If karen finds scope creep or structural drift: STOP and fix it immediately
   - If karen approves: Continue implementation

5. **Complete Implementation**
   - Finish remaining work on both platforms
   - Ensure both platforms compile
   - Verify feature parity

6. **👤 USER APPROVAL CHECKPOINT #2: Review Implementation** (MANDATORY)
   - **STOP and show user the implementation**
   - Demonstrate:
     - What was implemented on web
     - What was implemented on iOS
     - How to test it locally (provide commands)
     - Show actual code changes (file paths and snippets)
   - User can:
     - ✅ Approve - Proceed to Phase 3 (testing)
     - ✋ Request changes - Make adjustments and show again
     - ❌ Cancel - Stop work
   - **Do NOT proceed to testing phase without user seeing the implementation**

**Deliverable**: Working feature in Playground on both web and iOS, user has reviewed and approved

---

### PHASE 3: Testing & Quality Assurance

**Goal**: Ensure feature works correctly and meets quality standards

**Steps**:
1. **Unit Testing** (if complex business logic)
   - Use `unit-test-generator` for shared package tests
   - 80%+ coverage for business logic

2. **UI Testing** (MANDATORY for any web UI changes)
   - Use `ui-comprehensive-tester` with Playwright for end-to-end flows
   - **Web**: Always run Playwright against `http://localhost:5173/playground`
   - **Screenshots/output**: Always save to `.playwright-mcp/` in the repo root — never the working directory
   - Test all display modes (light/dark, responsive)
   - Minimum scenarios to cover:
     - Feature section exists and expands
     - Happy path (valid submission, task appears)
     - Required field validation (empty submit shows errors)
     - Edge cases specific to the feature

3. **Quality Validation** (MANDATORY)
   - Use `testing-czar` to verify:
     - Code compiles on BOTH platforms
     - All tests pass
     - No regressions
     - Security best practices followed
   - **GATE**: If compilation fails, work is INCOMPLETE

4. **Code Quality Review**
   - Use `code-quality-pragmatist` to check:
     - No over-engineering
     - No unnecessary complexity
     - No features outside approved plan

**Deliverable**: Tested, high-quality feature that compiles and runs on both platforms

---

### PHASE 4: Verification & Integration Readiness

**Goal**: Verify feature is complete, correct, and ready for user testing

**Steps**:
1. **Specification Verification** (MANDATORY)
   - Use `Jenny` to verify:
     - Implementation matches original specification
     - All requirements met
     - Cross-platform parity achieved — same features AND same file structure
     - **NO scope creep** (no unapproved features)
     - **Structural mirroring**: count files in `components/playground/` vs `Views/Playground/` — they should match
   - **GATE**: If scope exceeded or structure diverges, fix immediately

2. **⚠️ GATE #3: karen Final Reality Check** (MANDATORY)
   - Invoke `karen` for final verification
   - karen must verify:
     - Feature actually works (not just looks complete)
     - **Deliverable matches original user request EXACTLY - word for word**
     - **Create a comparison table: User requested vs. What was delivered**
     - Both platforms compile and run
     - No unapproved features exist
     - No "bonus" functionality added
     - Nothing beyond the minimum necessary to fulfill the request
     - **Structural mirror check**: verify container views are thin, each feature/component is a separate file on both platforms, no logic inlined in the container
   - karen should **actually test** the feature in Playground
   - **GATE**: If doesn't work, has scope creep, or has structural drift, work is INCOMPLETE

3. **Prepare Delivery Summary**
   - What was implemented (match to original request)
   - How to test it (instructions for both platforms)
   - What's in scope vs. out of scope
   - Verification report (all gates passed)

**Deliverable**: Verified, working feature ready for final user approval

---

### PHASE 5: Final User Approval & Completion

**Goal**: User tests feature in Playground and gives final approval

**Steps**:
1. **👤 USER APPROVAL CHECKPOINT #3: Final Testing & Approval** (MANDATORY)
   - **Present complete feature to user**
   - Provide:
     - Testing instructions for both platforms
     - Verification report (all gates passed)
     - What was implemented vs. what was deferred
     - How feature fulfills original request
   - **User tests in Playground**:
     - User manually tests all scenarios
     - User verifies cross-platform consistency
     - User checks all display modes
   - User can:
     - ✅ Approve - Feature is COMPLETE
     - ✋ Request changes - Return to appropriate phase and re-run gates
     - ❌ Reject - Document issues and learnings

2. **Completion**
   - If user approves: Feature is DONE (stays in Playground until integration decision)
   - If user requests changes: Return to appropriate phase, make changes, re-run all gates
   - If user finds scope creep: Document failure, update process to prevent recurrence

**Deliverable**: User-approved feature in Playground, ready for future integration (when user decides)

---

## The Three-Gate Karen System

**Critical**: karen is invoked at THREE mandatory checkpoints:

### Gate #1: Plan Review (End of Phase 1)
- **Before**: Plan is created
- **After**: Plan is approved or revised, with user feedback on optional features
- **Purpose**: Identify core vs. optional features, get user input on optional features, prevent unwanted scope creep
- **Process**: karen identifies core (requested) and optional (not requested) features → user decides which optional features to keep → plan revised based on user decisions

### Gate #2: Mid-Implementation Check (During Phase 2)
- **Before**: ~50% implementation complete
- **After**: Implementation continues or scope creep is removed
- **Purpose**: Catch scope creep early before too much work done

### Gate #3: Final Reality Check (End of Phase 4)
- **Before**: Feature claims to be complete
- **After**: Feature is verified working or marked incomplete
- **Purpose**: Ensure deliverable matches request, actually works, and both platforms mirror each other's structure

**If ANY gate fails, the work is INCOMPLETE and must be fixed.**

---

## The Three User Approval Checkpoints

**Critical**: User must approve at THREE mandatory checkpoints:

### 👤 Checkpoint #1: Approve Plan (End of Phase 1)
- **Before**: Plan is created and karen-approved
- **After**: User approves plan or requests changes
- **Purpose**: Ensure user agrees with approach before implementation starts
- **User sees**: What will be implemented, testing strategy, what's out of scope

### 👤 Checkpoint #2: Review Implementation (End of Phase 2)
- **Before**: Implementation is complete
- **After**: User reviews code and approves or requests changes
- **Purpose**: Let user see actual implementation before extensive testing
- **User sees**: Code changes, how to test locally, what was built

### 👤 Checkpoint #3: Final Testing & Approval (End of Phase 5)
- **Before**: All testing and verification complete
- **After**: User tests feature and gives final approval
- **Purpose**: User validates feature meets their needs
- **User sees**: Complete feature in Playground, verification report, testing instructions

**If user doesn't approve at ANY checkpoint, work stops until issues are addressed.**

---

## Checkpoint Summary

The workflow has **6 mandatory checkpoints** (3 karen gates + 3 user approvals):

| Phase | Checkpoint | Type | Purpose |
|-------|-----------|------|---------|
| End of Phase 1 | Gate #1: karen Plan Review + User Feedback | Scope | Identify core vs optional features, user decides on optional items |
| End of Phase 1 | 👤 Checkpoint #1: User Approves Plan | Approval | User agrees with final approach (after optional feature decisions) |
| Mid Phase 2 | Gate #2: karen Mid-Check | Scope | Catch scope creep + structural drift early |
| End of Phase 2 | 👤 Checkpoint #2: User Reviews Code | Approval | User sees implementation |
| End of Phase 4 | Gate #3: karen Final Check | Scope | Verify deliverable matches request + structural mirror |
| End of Phase 5 | 👤 Checkpoint #3: User Final Approval | Approval | User validates feature |

**All 6 checkpoints are MANDATORY - skip none.**

---

## Compilation Verification Checklist

Before claiming work is complete:

### Web Compilation
```bash
cd /Users/stephen/repos/oybc/apps/web
pnpm build
```
**Must succeed with zero errors**

### iOS Compilation
1. Open `/Users/stephen/repos/oybc/apps/ios/OYBC.xcodeproj` in Xcode
2. Build (⌘R)
3. **Must build successfully for simulator**

If either fails, work is INCOMPLETE.

---

## Output Format

After completing the workflow, provide:

### 1. Executive Summary
- Feature name and description
- **What was implemented (must match EXACTLY to original request)**
- **What was NOT implemented (out of scope items)**
- Platforms: Web ✅ | iOS ✅
- All gates passed: Gate #1 ✅ | Gate #2 ✅ | Gate #3 ✅
- Compilation verified: Web ✅ | iOS ✅
- **Scope verification: No unapproved features added ✅**

### 2. Testing Instructions
**Web**:
```bash
cd apps/web
pnpm dev
# Navigate to http://localhost:5173/playground
# Look for "[Feature Name]" section
```

**iOS**:
```
1. Open apps/ios/OYBC.xcodeproj in Xcode
2. Build and run (⌘R)
3. Tap "Go to Playground"
4. Find "[Feature Name]" section
```

### 3. What's Next
- Feature is in Playground and ready for your testing
- Test all scenarios and display modes
- When satisfied, let me know and we can discuss integration
- **Do NOT integrate without your explicit approval**

### 4. Verification Report
- testing-czar: ✅ Passed
- Jenny: ✅ No scope creep, matches spec
- karen Gate #1: ✅ Plan approved
- karen Gate #2: ✅ Mid-implementation check passed
- karen Gate #3: ✅ Final reality check passed

---

## Example Invocation

```
/feature Add a dark mode toggle button to the Playground navbar
```

This would:
1. Create plan with testing strategy
2. Gate #1: karen identifies core features (dark mode toggle) and optional features (e.g., hover states, transitions, accessibility)
3. Ask user: "Include hover states? Include smooth transition? Include keyboard support?"
4. User decides which optional features to keep
5. Revise plan based on user's decisions
6. 👤 Checkpoint #1: Present final plan to user for approval
7. Implement toggle in Playground on web and iOS (only approved features)
8. Gate #2: karen checks at 50% completion (verify only approved features implemented)
9. 👤 Checkpoint #2: Show implementation to user for approval
10. Test and verify compilation
11. Gate #3: karen final reality check (compare to approved plan)
12. 👤 Checkpoint #3: User tests and gives final approval

---

## Remember

- **Playground FIRST** - Never integrate without approval
- **Scope discipline** - Only implement what was requested
- **Six checkpoints** - 3 karen gates + 3 user approvals (ALL mandatory)
- **User involvement** - User approves plan, reviews code, tests feature
- **Testing strategy** - Plan testing approach during Phase 1
- **Compilation** - Both platforms must build
- **Stop and wait** - Get user approval before proceeding past checkpoints

This is a **quality-first, scope-controlled, user-involved** workflow. Better to deliver less that works than more that doesn't compile or includes unwanted features.
